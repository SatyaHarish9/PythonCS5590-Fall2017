Sachin Tendulkar and Ramakant Achrekar are two of the most famed student-teacher combination known in the country. On Tuesday, on the occasion of Teacher’s Day, the Master Blaster went down memory lane to share an anecdote of the moment when he learnt the biggest lesson of his life from Achrekar and it came in the form of a scolding at Wankhede Stadium.

Long before his debut in 1989, Sachin needed the mentoring of two men who provided constant support to him – his brother Ajit and coach Achrekar. A prankster in his youth days, Sachin would get himself into trouble a lot and would be brought back to line by the two men. He recalled one incident which is still etched in his memory after all these years.
